This project analyzes airport traffic through time series modeling, focusing on data preprocessing and visualization. Using SARIMA and SARIMAX models, the study aims to predict future traffic patterns, leveraging optimized hyperparameters for accuracy. Key sections include data handling, model selection, and parameter tuning, with R scripts supporting the process.
